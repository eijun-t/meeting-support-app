			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into subtasks such as initializing the repository, installing Next.js with TypeScript, configuring Tailwind CSS, and verifying the setup with a test component.",
			"reasoning": "This task is straightforward and well-documented, involving standard steps for initializing a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The process is mostly sequential and can be split into a few clear subtasks, as outlined in official documentation and best practices.[5][3]"

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Design UI Layout",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for wireframing, implementing the main layout, creating the transcription area, summary section, and control buttons, and ensuring responsiveness.",
			"reasoning": "Designing a responsive UI layout with multiple sections requires both planning and implementation. It involves creating and styling several components, ensuring responsiveness, and integrating them into a cohesive layout."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Microphone Access",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide this task into subtasks for adding UI controls, requesting microphone permissions, handling permission responses, and verifying audio stream acquisition.",
			"reasoning": "Enabling microphone access is a moderately complex task that involves browser APIs, user permissions, and UI integration. Each step is distinct and can be separated for clarity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Real-time Speech-to-Text Transcription",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into integrating the speech recognition library, connecting it to the audio stream, handling real-time transcription events, updating the UI, managing errors, and testing accuracy.",
			"reasoning": "Real-time speech-to-text involves integrating external APIs, handling streaming data, updating the UI in real time, and managing potential errors, making it a relatively complex feature."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Session Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for implementing start/stop controls, managing session state, clearing/resetting data, updating the UI, and testing state transitions.",
			"reasoning": "Session management requires state handling, UI updates, and ensuring data consistency, which are standard but non-trivial tasks in a React application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Periodic Summary Generation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for implementing the timer, extracting transcript data, applying the summarization algorithm, displaying the summary, handling timing edge cases, and testing with sample data.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves timed operations, text processing, algorithm integration, and UI updates, each of which adds to the overall complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Local Data Storage",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for selecting storage method, implementing audio storage, implementing text storage, retrieving data, and verifying data persistence.",
			"reasoning": "Storing and retrieving data locally involves choosing the right browser storage, implementing serialization/deserialization, and ensuring data integrity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "User Flow Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for integrating each major component (UI, microphone, transcription, summary, storage), coordinating state and data flow, handling transitions, and performing end-to-end testing.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating all components for a seamless user experience is complex, requiring coordination between multiple features, state management, and thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Error Handling and Edge Cases",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for identifying possible errors, implementing error handling for microphone access, transcription, and storage, providing user feedback, and testing edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "Robust error handling requires anticipating various failure modes, implementing appropriate responses, and ensuring the user is informed, which adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Documentation and Code Review",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for writing setup documentation, usage instructions, architecture overview, and conducting a code review against best practices.",
			"reasoning": "While essential, documentation and code review are straightforward tasks that can be clearly divided and executed in parallel."
