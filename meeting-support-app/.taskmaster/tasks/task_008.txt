# Task ID: 8
# Title: User Flow Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate all components to implement the full user flow as described in the PRD.
# Details:
Connect UI, microphone access, transcription, summary, and data storage to provide a seamless user experience from meeting start to end.

# Test Strategy:
End-to-end test the complete user flow, including all steps from PRD.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate User Interface (UI) Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and integrate the main UI, ensuring it is minimalist, intuitive, and supports both visual and voice interactions.
### Details:
Design a clutter-free interface that provides clear feedback and allows users to easily access microphone controls, view transcriptions, summaries, and stored data. Ensure accessibility and support for multimodal interactions.

## 2. Integrate Microphone Input Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement microphone access and controls, enabling users to start, pause, and stop voice input seamlessly from the UI.
### Details:
Ensure microphone controls are clearly visible and provide immediate feedback when activated. Handle permissions and errors gracefully.

## 3. Integrate Transcription Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Connect the microphone input to a transcription service to convert spoken audio into text in real time.
### Details:
Stream audio data to the transcription engine, display live transcription in the UI, and handle errors or interruptions smoothly.

## 4. Integrate Summary Generation Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Process transcribed text to generate concise summaries and display them in the UI.
### Details:
Trigger summary generation after transcription is complete or on user request. Present summaries clearly and allow users to compare with the full transcription.

## 5. Integrate Storage Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Implement secure storage for audio recordings, transcriptions, and summaries, allowing users to access and manage their data.
### Details:
Enable saving, retrieving, and deleting of session data. Ensure privacy and security best practices are followed.

## 6. Coordinate State and Data Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.5
### Description: Establish robust state management and data flow between all components to ensure seamless user experience and data consistency.
### Details:
Synchronize UI updates with microphone, transcription, summary, and storage states. Handle transitions between states (e.g., recording to transcribing) and preserve user context.

## 7. Perform End-to-End Testing and Handle Transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test the integrated system across all user flows, focusing on transitions between components and overall reliability.
### Details:
Simulate real user scenarios, verify smooth transitions (e.g., from recording to summary display), and ensure error handling and feedback are consistent. Address any issues found during testing.
