# Task ID: 5
# Title: Session Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement meeting session start/stop controls and state management.
# Details:
Add buttons to start and stop meetings. Manage session state (active/inactive) and clear/reset data as needed.

# Test Strategy:
Test session start/stop functionality and state transitions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Start/Stop Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop UI components and logic to allow users to start and stop sessions. Ensure controls trigger appropriate state changes and actions.
### Details:
Create React components (e.g., buttons) for starting and stopping sessions. Connect these controls to session state logic using hooks or Redux actions as appropriate.

## 2. Manage Session State [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Set up session state management using a suitable approach (e.g., React context, Redux, or a session management library). Ensure session data is stored, updated, and accessible throughout the app.
### Details:
Integrate a session management solution such as redux-react-session or react-session-api. Implement logic to handle session creation, updates, and termination based on user actions.

## 3. Implement Data Clearing and Resetting [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Add functionality to clear or reset session-related data when a session ends or is manually reset by the user.
### Details:
Ensure that session data is properly cleared from state and storage (e.g., cookies, sessionStorage) when stopping or resetting a session. Provide UI feedback for successful data clearing.

## 4. Update the UI Based on Session State [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Ensure the UI reflects the current session state, displaying appropriate controls, messages, and data depending on whether a session is active, stopped, or reset.
### Details:
Use conditional rendering to show/hide controls and information based on session state. Update UI elements in response to state changes using hooks or state selectors.

## 5. Test State Transitions and Data Consistency [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Write and execute tests to verify correct behavior of session start/stop, data clearing, and UI updates. Ensure state transitions are handled reliably and data remains consistent.
### Details:
Create unit and integration tests for session controls, state management logic, and UI updates. Test edge cases such as rapid start/stop actions and unexpected resets.
