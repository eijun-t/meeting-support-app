# Task ID: 6
# Title: Periodic Summary Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Generate and display a summary of the conversation every 2 minutes.
# Details:
Implement a timer to trigger summary generation every 2 minutes. Use a simple text summarization algorithm (e.g., extractive summarization) on the transcribed text. Display the summary in the dedicated UI area.

# Test Strategy:
Test summary generation timing and accuracy using sample transcripts.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Timer Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the timer logic to trigger actions at specified intervals, ensuring accurate and reliable countdown or interval timing.
### Details:
Use appropriate timing APIs (e.g., setInterval, requestAnimationFrame, or performance.now) and consider drift correction and precision for robust timer behavior.

## 2. Extract Transcript Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a module to extract and preprocess transcript data from the source, preparing it for summarization.
### Details:
Ensure the extraction process is efficient and compatible with the timer's triggers, handling various transcript formats if necessary.

## 3. Apply Summarization Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Integrate and execute the summarization algorithm on the extracted transcript data to generate concise summaries.
### Details:
Select or implement a summarization algorithm suitable for the transcript data, optimizing for speed and accuracy.

## 4. Display Summary in UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Develop the user interface component to display the generated summary to users in a clear and timely manner.
### Details:
Ensure the UI updates seamlessly with new summaries as they are generated, maintaining a responsive user experience.

## 5. Handle Timing Edge Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.4
### Description: Identify and address edge cases related to timer accuracy, drift, and synchronization to ensure reliable operation.
### Details:
Implement solutions for timing drift, missed intervals, and synchronization issues, possibly using high-resolution timers or server time checks.

## 6. Test with Sample Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing using sample transcript data to validate the entire workflow and ensure robustness.
### Details:
Test all components together, including timer accuracy, transcript extraction, summarization quality, UI updates, and edge case handling.
