# Task ID: 9
# Title: Error Handling and Edge Cases
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement robust error handling for common edge cases.
# Details:
Handle errors such as microphone access denial, transcription failures, and storage errors. Provide user feedback for each case.

# Test Strategy:
Test error scenarios and verify appropriate user feedback is displayed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify Possible Error Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: List and analyze potential errors that can occur during microphone access, audio transcription, and data storage, including issues like poor audio quality, misheard words, and storage failures.
### Details:
Review common error types such as ambiguous audio, technical jargon, background noise, fast speech, and storage limitations. Consider both technical and user-related error sources.

## 2. Implement Error Handling for Microphone Access [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop mechanisms to detect and handle errors related to microphone permissions, device availability, and hardware failures.
### Details:
Include checks for user permissions, device connectivity, and fallback strategies if the microphone is unavailable or access is denied.

## 3. Implement Error Handling for Transcription Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create robust error handling for the transcription process, addressing issues such as poor audio quality, unclear speech, and technical jargon.
### Details:
Incorporate strategies like noise reduction, retries for unclear segments, and logging of ambiguous audio for manual review.

## 4. Implement Error Handling for Data Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Add error handling for storing transcribed data, covering scenarios like storage quota exceeded, write failures, and data corruption.
### Details:
Ensure that errors are caught and logged, and provide fallback options such as local storage or user prompts to retry.

## 5. Provide User Feedback on Errors [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Design and implement user feedback mechanisms to inform users about errors and guide them on corrective actions.
### Details:
Display clear, actionable messages for each error type, such as microphone access denied, unclear audio detected, or storage issues.

## 6. Test Edge Cases and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Develop and execute test cases for edge scenarios, including rapid permission changes, extremely poor audio, and storage failures, to validate error handling and user feedback.
### Details:
Simulate various failure modes and verify that the system responds appropriately, logs errors, and provides meaningful feedback to users.
